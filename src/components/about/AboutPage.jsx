                    At BrokeBites, our mission is to empower students with the
                    knowledge and savvy to find budget-friendly takeaway options
                    that don't compromise on taste. We believe that eating on a
                    shoestring budget should never mean sacrificing flavor or
                    convenience.

                    We understand that cooking your own meals might not always
                    be feasible due to time constraints or lack of cooking
                    facilities. That's why we've curated a selection of smart
                    and pocket-friendly takeaway options from various
                    restaurants that cater to students on a budget. Now you can
                    enjoy a diverse range of flavors without the hassle of
                    cooking!
